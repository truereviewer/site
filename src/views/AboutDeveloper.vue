        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          I've worked on many e-commerce and SaaS projects over the years. Most of them required two
          key reusable features: a commenting system and a review system. We often had to rely on
          paid third-party plugins because there were no suitable open-source solutions that covered
          both the front-end and back-end effectively. A few packages handled the back-end only.
          Frankly, building the back-end isn't that time-consuming thanks to Laravel's powerful
          capabilities. However, creating a polished, user-friendly front-end requires significant
          time, effort, and creativity. So, I decided to tackle this problem for myselfâ€”and for
          others. i'am a heavy user of open-souce technologies so I also wanted to give someting
          back to the community. I started with the commenting system. After a huge effort, I was
          able to release
          <a href="https://github.com/Lakshan-Madushanka/laravel-comments" target="_blank"
            >Commenter</a
          >
          to the community. With 400+ stars and over 5,000 downloads, itâ€™s clear that the effort
          paid off.
          <a href="https://github.com/Lakshan-Madushanka/laravel-comments" target="_blank"
            >Commenter</a
          >
          is full open-source and actively maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I began developing a review system. Commenter was built with Livewire, which made it
          cumbersome to use outside Livewire-based projects. So, this time, I wanted to build
          something that works with any Laravel projectâ€”regardless of the technologies used. The
          plan was to make it open source from the start, but I ended up spending far more time and
          effort than I had anticipated. I had to sacrifice a lot of my personal and professional
          work to get it done. Because of that, I made the difficult decision to release it as
          sponsorware. I hope you find it fair to charge a small fee for the effort involvedâ€”and I
          still hope to make it fully open source in the future, based on community feedback. I
          believe Reviewer is one of the most advanced review systems available for Laravel. I hope
          you enjoy using it and that it meets your needs. Reviewer will be actively maintained, and
          you're welcome to contact me with any questions at
